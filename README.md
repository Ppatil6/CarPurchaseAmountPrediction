# CarPurchaseAmountPrediction
Car Dealership Customer Purchasing Power Prediction using Neural Networks.

In this project we assume that we work as a data scientist at a car dealership and we would like to predict the purchasing power of customers based on their features. We are analyzing customer behavior by predicting how much they are willing to pay using features such as customer age, annual salary, credit card debt and net worth. We are building neural network using Keras, optimizing neural network using Atom optimizer, loading database i.e. csv files using Pandas, visualizing data using Seaborn library, normalizing and training datasets using Scikit-Learn.
